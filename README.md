# Product Recommendation System

This is a hybrid product recommendation system that integrates collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide accurate product recommendations. The system is built using Python and employs machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Cosine Similarity, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for enhanced recommendation accuracy. The project is implemented using Google Colab and Tkinter for the GUI.

## Project Overview
This recommendation system leverages a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized product recommendations. The system was tested and trained on Amazon product datasets, containing 2 million customer reviews and ratings. It achieved a recommendation accuracy of approximately 90%, enhancing the user experience by offering relevant product suggestions.

## Features
- **Hybrid Recommendation**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
- **User Interface**: Simple GUI created with Tkinter.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Cosine Similarity, and SVD to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Large-Scale Dataset Support**: Handles Amazon product datasets with millions of reviews efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: KNN, Cosine Similarity, SVD
- **Platform**: Google Colab
- **GUI**: Tkinter

## Dataset
The recommendation system uses Amazon product datasets containing 2 million customer reviews and ratings. This dataset provides valuable insights into user preferences and allows for robust testing and training of the model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Product-Recommendation-System.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Amazon product dataset and place it in the `data` folder.

4. Run the `main.py` file to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> **Note**: This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. The GUI will open, allowing you to enter user details or select specific product categories.
3. The system will generate a list of recommended products based on collaborative and content-based filtering.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: The system achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% in recommendation relevancy.
- **Performance**: Efficiently handles large datasets and provides recommendations within seconds.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional algorithms, such as matrix factorization and neural networks, for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
- Add more product filters and user profile customization options.
- Deploy the application as a web-based service for broader accessibility.
